          As a web developer, it is nowadays really difficult to master one
          language to its full potential as we have to be familiar with every
          new technology. but knowing the useful, important, time-saving and
          handy features will be a great idea to upgrade oneself. Especially
          using the unknown and less popular features will make you ahead of the
          crowd in your job or circle.

          <p>
            Many times we encountered the situation where we are hardcoding the
            same URL in HTML throughout the entire project. It happens usually
            with a website having many pages on a single domain and is used on
            the entire application to route the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the most appropriate and awesome way to handle it is by using
            &lt;base&gt; tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;base&gt; tag is used to specify a most common url in the
            &lt;head&gt; tag so that in the entire application we can use the
            relative path.

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>target</span>: optional , we can specify the target for all
            links using relative path.

            The inputs for searching a product, city, state, person, and more
            are most commonly used nowadays to easily navigate or show the user
            in no time. But the user always doesnâ€™t know what to enter mostly
            when he/she is searching for products. To give the user the hints
            and promote the top products you can use &lt;datalist&gt; tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;datalist&gt; can be provided with the many options which will

            Nowadays accordions are pretty much used in every website but they
            are built with huge CSS or js. There is a solution to this problem.
            It is not the ideal solution styling wise but it can be really
            time-saving and handy to use.

            The most common way to indicate the user on a successful or
            unsuccessful event is to show a dialog with respective messages.
            These days instead of popups we are mostly using the inline text
            which is showing an error message or success on an event. Now to
            make this work we have to deal with many things if we are using
            vanilla js.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make a simple dialog with just one attribute open or close we can
            prefer &lt;dialog&gt; in which everything works same as div the only
            difference is that the text inside the dialog can be visible or
            hidden based on the attribute passed.

            In your development journey, you may have come across the use of
            &lt;picture&gt; tag or at least listen to it while learning HTML. It
            can be the most powerful tool for placing the perfect image in your
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the developers use &lt;img&gt; tag (including me ðŸ˜…) and
            style it with media queries to adapt a decent look in most the
            screen size. The images and graphics are really impacting the look
            and feel of the website, Hence the &lt;img&gt; usage does not offer
            a good solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;picture&gt; is similar to a video tag providing multiple sources
            for a single image to give the browser more power to nicely select
            the one best fit for the current screen size.it also uses
            &lt;img&gt; tag as a fallback element if none of the sources matches
          </p>

            Tags and attributes required:
          </Title>
          <p>
            <span>&ltsource&gt; : </span>can provide one or more sources to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&lt;img&gt; : </span>as a fallback image if none of the
            sources matches at the bottom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>media : </span> to provide a media querry based on which
            browser uses the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Srcset: </span> to give an absolute or relative path of the
            image.
